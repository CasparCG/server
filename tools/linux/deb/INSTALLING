Installation from Graphical User Interface

    Double click on the casparcg-cef package. Click the install
    button and follow the prompts. This can then be repeated for
    the casparcg-server and casparcg-scanner packages if desired. 

Installation from Command Line

    At the command prompt type:

        # sudo dpkg -i casparcg-*.deb

    Then fix up any missing dependencies with:

        # sudo apt-get install -f

Running

    You will need to run both:

        # casparcg-scanner casparcg.config 
    
    and

        # casparcg-server-beta casparcg.config

    with the same config file and potentially working directory (if the config file uses relative paths).

    The server needs to be run as a normal user inside a running x11 server. The scanner can be run as a system service.
