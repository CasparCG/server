CasparCG 2.1.0 Beta 2 (w.r.t 2.1.0 Beta 1)
==========================================

General
-------

 * Fail early with clear error message if configured paths are not
    creatable/writable.
 * Added backwards compatibility (with deprecation warning) for using
    thumbnails-path instead of thumbnail-path in casparcg.config.
 * Suppress the logging of full path names in stack traces so that only the
    relative path within the source tree is visible.
 * General stability improvements.
 * Native thread id is now logged in Linux as well. Finally they are mappable
    against INFO THREADS, ps and top.
 * Created automatically generated build number, so that it is easier to see
    whether a build is newer or older than an other.
 * Changed configuration element mipmapping_default_on to mipmapping-default-on
    for consistency with the rest of the configuration (Jesper Stærkær).
 * Handle stdin EOF as EXIT.

    (Antonio Ruano Cuesta).
 * Fixed serious buffer overrun in FFmpeg logging code.

Consumers
---------

 * FFmpeg consumer:
   * Fixed long overdue bug where HD material was always recorded using the
      BT.601 color matrix instead of the BT.709 color matrix. RGB codecs like
      qtrle was never affected but all the YCbCr based codecs were.
   * Fixed bug in parsing of paths containing -.
   * Fixed bugs where previously effective arguments like -pix_fmt were
      ignored.
   * Fixed bug where interlaced channels where not recorded correctly for
      some codecs.
 * DeckLink consumer:
   * Rewrote the frame hand-off between send() and ScheduledFrameCompleted() in
      a way that hopefully resolves all dead-lock scenarios previously possible.
 * Bluefish consumer:
   * Largely rewritten against newest SDK Driver 5.11.0.47 (Satchit Nambiar and
      James Wise sponsored by Bluefish444):
     * Added support for Epoch Neutron and Supernova CG. All current Epoch
        cards are now supported.
     * Added support for for multiple SDI channels per card. 1 to 4 channels
        per Bluefish444 card depending on model and firmware.
     * Added support for single SDI output, complementing existing external key
        output support.
     * Added support for internal key using the Bluefish444 hardware keyer.
 * Screen consumer:
   * Fixed full screen mode.

Producers
---------

 * FFmpeg producer:
   * Increased the max number of frames that audio/video can be badly
      interleaved with (Dimitry Ishenko).
   * Fixed bug where decoders sometimes requires more than one video packet to
      decode the first frame.
   * Added support for IN and OUT parameters (Dimitry Ishenko).
   * Added DV/HDV video device support under Linux (Walter Sonius).
   * Remove unused flags variable in queued_seek (Dimitry Ishenko).
   * Now recognizes .ts files without probing contents (Ovidijus Striaukas).
   * Fixed uninitialized value causing initial log printout to usually say that
      clips are interlaced when they are not.
 * Destroy producer proxy:
   * Created workaround for bug in FFmpeg where every new thread used to
      cleanup caused handles to leak (not sure why). Reduced the effect by using
      only one thread for all producer destructions.
 * Framerate producer:
   * Fixed bug when INFO was used on a not yet playing framerate producer.
 * HTML producer:
   * Fixed bug where only URL:s with . in them where recognized.
 * Image producer:
   * Added LENGTH parameter to allow for queueing with LOADBG AUTO.
   * Fixed inconsistency in what file extensions are supported vs listed in
      CLS/CINF.
 * Layer producer:
   * Fixed serious bug where a circular reference of layer producers caused a
      stack overflow and server crash.
   * Can now route from layer on a channel with an incompatible framerate.
 * Channel producer:
   * Can now route from channel with an incompatible framerate.
   * Deinterlaces interlaced content from source channel.
   * Added optional NO_AUTO_DEINTERLACE parameter to opt out of the mentioned
      deinterlacing.
 * Scene producer:
   * Added abs(), floor(), to_lower(), to_upper() and length() functions to the
      expression language.
   * Created XML Schema for the *.scene XML format. Allows for IDE-like auto-
      completion, API documentation and validation.
   * Added possibility to specify the width and height of a layer instead of
      letting the producer on the layer decide.
   * Added global variables scene_width, scene_height and fps.
   * Made it possible to use expressions in keyframe values.
   * Fixed serious bug where uninitialized values were used.
   * Created more example scenes.
   * Can now forward CALL, CG PLAY, CG STOP, CG NEXT and CG INVOKE to the
      producer on a layer.
 * CG proxy wrapper producer:
   * New in 2.1.0.
   * Allows all CG producers to be used as an ordinary producer inside a layer
      in a scene.
   * Allows the Scene producer to know what variables are available in a
      template.
 * Color producer:
   * Now has support for gradients.
 * PSD producer:
   * Added support for centered and right justified text.
 * Text producer:
   * Fixed bug where tracking contributed to the overall text width on the
      last character.

Mixer
-----

 * Fixed bug in the contrast/saturation/brightness code where the wrong luma
    coefficients was used.
 * Rewrote the chroma key code to support variable hue, instead of fixed green
    or blue. Threshold setting was removed in favour of separate hue width,
    minimum saturation and minimum brightness constraints. Also a much more
    effective spill suppression method was implemented.
 * Fixed bug where glReadPixels() was done from the last drawn to texture
    instead of always from the target texture. This means that for example a
    MIXER KEYER layer without a layer above to key, as well as a separate alpha
    file with MIXER OPACITY 0 now works as expected.
 * Fixed bug where already drawn GL_QUADS were not composited against, causing
    for example italic texts to be rendered incorrectly in the text_producer.

AMCP
----

 * INFO PATHS now adds all the path elements even if they are using the default
    values.
 * MIXER CHROMA syntax deprecated (still supported) in favour of the more
    advanced syntax required by the rewritten chroma key code.
 * Added special command REQ that can be prepended before any command to
    identify the response with a client specified request id, allowing a client
    to know exactly what asynchronous response matched a specific request.
 * Added support for listing contents of a specific directory for CLS, TLS,
    DATA LIST and THUMBNAIL LIST.
 * Fixed bug where CINF only returned the first match.
 * Fixed bug where a client closing the connection after BYE instead of
    letting the server close the connection caused an exception to be logged.



CasparCG 2.1.0 Beta 1 (w.r.t 2.0.7 Stable)
==========================================

General
-------

 * 64 bit!
 * Linux support!
   * Moved to CMake build system for better platform independence.
     * Contributions before build system switch (not w.r.t 2.0.7 Stable):
       * gitrev.bat adaptions for 2.1 (Thomas Kaltz III).
   * Thanks to our already heavy use of the pimpl idiom, abstracting platform
      specifics was easily done by having different versions of the .cpp files
      included in the build depending on target platform. No #ifdef necessary,
      except for in header only platform specific code.
   * Flash, Bluefish and NewTek modules are not ported to the Linux build.
   * Contributions during development (not w.r.t 2.0.7 Stable):
     * Fixed compilation problems in Linux build (Dimitry Ishenko).
     * Fixed compilation problem in GCC 5 (Krzysztof Pyrkosz).
     * Fixed thumbnail image saving on Linux (Krzysztof Pyrkosz).
     * Fixed compilation problem in PSD module (Krzysztof Pyrkosz).
 * Major code refactoring:
   * Mixer abstraction so different implementations can be created. Currently
      CPU mixer and GPU mixer (previously the usage of the GPU was mandatory)
      exists.
   * Flattened folder structure for easier inclusion of header files.
   * Many classes renamed to better describe the abstractions they provide.
   * Sink parameters usually taken by value and moved into place instead of
      taken by const reference as previously done.
   * Old Windows specific AsyncEventServer class has been replaced by platform
      independent implementation based on Boost.Asio.
   * Pimpl classes are now stack allocated with internal shared_ptr to
      implementation, instead of both handle and body being dynamically
      allocated. This means that objects are now often passed by value instead
      of via safe_ptr/shared_ptr, because they are internally reference counted.
   * Protocol strategies are now easier to implement correctly, because of
      separation of state between different client connections.
   * Complete AMCP command refactoring.
   * On-line help system that forces the developer to document AMCP commands,
      producer syntaxes and consumer syntaxes making the documentation coupled
      to the code, which is great.
     * Added missing help for VERSION command (Jesper Stærkær).
   * Upgraded Windows build to target Visual Studio 2015 making it possible to
      use the C++11 features also supported by GCC 4.8 which is targeted on
      Linux.
     * Fixed compilation problems in Visual Studio 2015 Update 1
        (Roman Tarasov)
   * Created abstraction of the different forms of templates (flash, html, psd
      and scene). Each module registers itself as a CG producer provides. All CG
      commands transparently works with all of them.
   * Audio mixer now uses double samples instead of float samples to fully
      accommodate all int32 samples.
   * Reduced coupling between core and modules (and modules and modules):
     * Modules can register system info providers to contribute to INFO SYSTEM.
     * XML configuration factories for adding support for new consumer elements
        in casparcg.config.
     * Server startup hooks can be registered (used by HTML producer to fork
        its sub process).
     * Version providers can contribute content to the VERSION command.
 * Refactored multichannel audio support to use FFmpeg's PAN filter and
    simplified the configuration a lot.
 * Upgraded most third party libraries we depend on.
 * Some unit tests have been created.
 * Renamed README.txt to README, CHANGES.txt to CHANGELOG and LICENSE.txt to
    LICENSE
 * Created README.md for github front page in addition to README which is
    distributed with builds.
 * README file updates (Jonas Hummelstrand).
 * Created BUILDING file describing how to build the server on Windows and
    Linux.
 * Diagnostics:
   * Now also sent over OSC.
   * Diag window is now scrollable and without squeezing of graphs.
   * Contextual information such as video channel and video layer now included
      in graphs.
 * Logging:
   * Implemented a TCP server, simply sending every log line to each connected
      client. Default port is 3250.
   * Changed default log level to info and moved debug statements that are
      interesting in a production system to info.
   * Try to not log full stack traces when user error is the cause. Stacktraces
      should ideally only be logged when a system error or a programming error
      has occurred.
   * More contextual information about an error added to exceptions. An example
      of this is that XML configuration errors now cause the XPath of the error
      is logged.
   * Improved the readability of the log format.
   * Added optional calltrace.log for logging method calls. Allows for trace
      logging to be enabled while calltracing is disabled etc.

OSC
---

 * Improved message formatting performance.
 * Added possibility to disable sending OSC to connected AMCP clients.
 * Fixed inconsistent element name predefined_client to predefined-client in
    casparcg.config (Krzysztof Pyrkosz).

Consumers
---------

 * System audio consumer:
   * Pushes data to openal instead of being callbacked by SFML when data is
      needed.
   * Added possibility to specify the expected delay in the sound card. Might
      help get better consumer synchronization.
 * Screen consumer:
   * Added mouse interaction support, usable by the producers running on the
      video channel.
 * FFmpeg consumer:
   * Replaced by Streaming Consumer after it was adapted to support everything
      that FFmpeg Consumer did.
   * Added support for recording all audio channels into separate mono audio
      streams.
   * Now sends recording progress via OSC.
 * SyncTo consumer:
   * New in 2.1.0.
   * Allows the pace of a channel to follow another channel. This is useful for
      virtual "precomp" channels without a DeckLink consumer to pace it.
 * DeckLink consumer:
   * Added workaround for timescale bug found in Decklink SDK 10.7.
   * Now ScheduledFrameCompleted is no longer only used for video scheduling
      but for audio as well, simplifying the code a lot.
 * iVGA consumer:
   * No longer provides sync to the video channel.
   * Supports NewTek NDI out of the box just by upgrading the
      Processing.AirSend library.

Producers
---------

 * Scene producer:
   * New in 2.1.0.
   * Utilizes CasparCG concepts such as producers, mixer transforms and uses
      them in a nested way to form infinite number of sub layers. Think movie
      clip in Flash.
   * A scene consists of variables, layers, timelines and marks (intro and
      outro for example).
   * Mostly for use by other producers but comes with a XML based producer that
      is a registered CG producer and shows up in TLS.
   * Enables frame accurate compositions and animations.
   * Has a powerful variable binding system (think expressions in After Effects
      or JavaFX Bindings).
 * PSD producer:
   * New in 2.1.0.
   * Parses PSD files and sets up a scene for the Scene producer to display.
   * Text layers based on CG parameters.
   * Supports Photoshop timeline.
   * Uses Photoshop comment key-frames to describe where intro and outro (CG
      PLAY and CG STOP) should be in the timeline.
   * Shows up as regular templates in TLS.
 * Text producer:
   * New in 2.1.0.
   * Renders text using FreeType library.
   * Is used by the PSD producer for dynamic text layers.
 * Image scroll producer:
   * Speed can be changed while running using a CALL. The speed change can be
      tweened.
   * Added support for an absolute end time so that the duration is calculated
      based on when PLAY is called for shows when an exact end time is
      important.
 * Image producer:
   * Fixed bug where too large (OpenGL limit) images were accepted, causing
      problems during thumbnail generation.
 * Framerate producer:
   * New in 2.1.0.
   * Wraps a producer with one framerate and converts it to another. It is not
      usable on its own but is utilized in the FFmpeg producer and the DeckLink
      consumer.
   * Supports different interpolation algorithms. Currently a no-op
      drop-and-repeat mode and a two different frame blending modes.
   * It also supports changing the speed on demand with tweening support.
 * FFmpeg producer:
   * Supports decoding all audio streams from a clip. Useful with .mxf files
      which usually have separate mono streams for every audio channel.
   * No longer do framerate conversion (half or double), but delegates that
      task to the Framerate producer.
   * Added support for v4l2 devices.
   * Added relative and "from end" seeking (Dimitry Ishenko).
   * Contributions during development (not w.r.t 2.0.7 Stable):
     * Fixed 100% CPU problem on clip EOF (Peter Keuter, Robert Nagy).
     * Constrained SEEK within the length of a clip (Dimitry Ishenko).
     * Fixed a regular expression (Dimitry Ishenko).
 * DeckLink producer:
   * No longer do framerate conversion (half or double), but delegates that
      task to the Framerate producer.
 * Route producer:
   * Added possibility to delay frames routed from a layer or a channel.
 * HTML Producer:
   * Disabled web security in HTML Producer (Robert Nagy).
   * Reimplemented requestAnimationFrame handling in Javascript instead of C++.
   * Implemented cancelAnimationFrame.
   * Increased animation smoothness in HTML Producer with interlaced video
      modes.
   * Added remote debugging support.
   * Added mouse interaction support by utilizing the Screen consumer's new
      interaction support.
 * Flash Producer:
   * Contributions during development (not w.r.t 2.0.7 Stable):
     * Workaround for flickering with high CPU usage and CPU accelerator
        (Robert Nagy)

AMCP
----

 * TLS has a new column for "template type" for clients that want to
    differentiate between html and flash for example.
 * SET CHANNEL_LAYOUT added to be able to change the audio channel layout of a
    video channel at runtime.
 * HELP command added for accessing the new on-line help system.
 * FLS added to list the fonts usable by the Text producer.
 * LOCK command added for controlling/gaining exclusive access to a video
    channel.
 * LOG CATEGORY command added to enable/disable the new log categories.
 * SWAP command now optionally supports swapping the transforms as well as the
    layers.
 * VERSION command can now provide CEF version.



CasparCG Server 2.0.7 Stable (as compared to CasparCG Server 2.0.7 Beta 2)
==========================================================================

General
-------

 * Added support for using a different configuration file at startup than the
    default casparcg.config by simply adding the name of the file to use as the
    first command line argument to casparcg.exe.
 * Upgraded FFmpeg to latest stable.
 * Created build script.
 * Fixed bug where both layer_producer and channel_producer display:s and
    empty/late first frame when the producer is called before the consumer in
    the other end has received the first frame.
 * Added rudimentary support for audio for layer_producer and channel_producer.
 * Upgraded DeckLink SDK to 10.1.4, bringing new 2K and 4K DCI video modes. New
    template hosts also available for those modes.
 * General bug fixes (mostly memory and resource leaks, some serious).
 * Updated Boost to version 1.57
 * Frontend no longer maintained and therefore not included in the release.

Mixer
-----

 * Added support for rotation.
 * Added support for changing the anchor point around which fill_translation,
    fill_scale and rotation will be done from.
 * Added support for perspective correct corner pinning.
 * Added support for mipmapped textures with anisotropic filtering for
    increased downscaling quality. Whether to enable by default can be
    configured in casparcg.config.
 * Added support for cropping a layer. Not the same as clipping.

AMCP
----

 * Added RESUME command to complement PAUSE. (Peter Keuter)
 * To support the new mixer features the following commands has been added:

   * MIXER ANCHOR -- will return or modify the anchor point for a layer
      (default is 0 0 for backwards compatibility). Example:
      MIXER 1-10 ANCHOR 0.5 0.5
      ...for changing the anchor to the middle of the layer
      (a MIXER 1-10 FILL 0.5 0.5 1 1 will be necessary to place the layer at the
      same place on screen as it was before).

   * MIXER ROTATION -- will return or modify the angle of which a layer is
      rotated by (clockwise degrees) around the point specified by ANCHOR.

   * MIXER PERSPECTIVE -- will return or modify the corners of the perspective
      transformation of a layer. One X Y pair for each corner (order upper left,
      upper right, lower right and lower left). Example:
      MIXER 1-10 PERSPECTIVE 0.4 0.4 0.6 0.4 1 1 0 1

   * MIXER MIPMAP -- will return or modify whether to enable mipmapping of
      textures produced on a layer. Only frames produced after a change will be
      affected. So for example image_producer will not be affected while the
      image is displayed.

   * MIXER CROP -- will return or modify how textures on a layer will be
      cropped. One X Y pair each for the upper left corner and for the lower
      right corner.

 * Added INFO QUEUES command for debugging AMCP command queues. Useful for
    debugging command queue overflows, where a command is deadlocked. Hopefully
    always accessible via console, even though the TCP command queue may be
    full.
 * Added GL command:
    - GL INFO prints information about device buffers and host buffers.
    - GL GC garbage collects pooled but unused GL resources.
 * Added INFO THREADS command listing the known threads and their descriptive
    names. Can be matched against the thread id column of log entries.

Consumers
---------

 * Removed blocking_decklink_consumer. It was more like an experiment at best
    and its usefulness was questionable.
 * Added a 10 second time-out for consumer sends, to detect/recover from
    blocked consumers.
 * Some consumers which are usually added and removed during playout (for
    example ffmpeg_consumer, streaming_consumer and channel_consumer) no longer
    affect the presentation time on other consumers. Previously a lag on the SDI
    output could be seen when adding such consumers.

HTML producer
-------------

 * No longer tries to play all files with a . in their name.
    (Georgi Chorbadzhiyski)
 * Reimplemented using CEF3 instead of Berkelium, which enables use of WebGL
    and more. CEF3 is actively maintained, which Berkelium is not. (Robert Nagy)
 * Implements a custom version of window.requestAnimationFrame which will
    follow the pace of the channel, for perfectly smooth animations.
 * No longer manually interlaces frames, to allow for mixer fill transforms
    without artifacts.
 * Now uses CEF3 event loop to avoid 100% CPU core usage.



CasparCG Server 2.0.7 Beta 2 (as compared to CasparCG Server 2.0.7 Beta 1)
==========================================================================

General
-------

 * Added sending of OSC messages for channel_grid channel in addition to
    regular channels.

Producers
---------

 * FFmpeg: Reports correct nb_frames() when using SEEK (Thomas Kaltz III)
 * Flash: Fixed bug where CG PLAY, CG INVOKE did not work.

Consumers
---------

 * channel_consumer: Added support for more than one channel_consumer per
    channel.
 * decklink_consumer: Added support for a single instance of the consumer to
    manage a separate key output for use with DeckLink Duo/Quad cards:

    <decklink>
      <device>1</device>
      <key-device>2</key-device>
      <keyer>external_separate_device</keyer>
    </decklink>

    ...in the configuration will enable the feature. The value of <key-device />
    defaults to the value of <device /> + 1.
 * synchronizing_consumer: Removed in favour of a single decklink_consumer
    managing both fill and key device.
 * streaming_consumer: A new implementation of ffmpeg_consumer with added
    support for streaming and other PTS dependent protocols. Examples:

    <stream>
      <path>udp://localhost:5004</path>
      <args>-vcodec libx264 -tune zerolatency -preset ultrafast -crf 25 -format mpegts -vf scale=240:180</args>
    </stream>

    ...in configuration or:

    ADD 1 STREAM udp://localhost:5004 -vcodec libx264 -tune zerolatency -preset ultrafast -crf 25 -format mpegts -vf scale=240:180

    ...via AMCP. (Robert Nagy sponsored by Ericsson Broadcasting Services)
 * newtek_ivga_consumer: Added support for iVGA consumer to not provide channel
    sync even though connected. Useful for iVGA clients that downloads as fast
    as possible instead of in frame-rate pace, like Wirecast. To enable:

    <newtek-ivga>
      <provide-sync>false</provide-sync>
    </newtek-ivga>

    ...in config to not provide channel sync when connected. The default is
    true.

AMCP
----

 * Added support in ADD and REMOVE for a placeholder <CLIENT_IP_ADDRESS> which
    will resolve to the connected AMCP client's IPV4 address.
 * Fixed bug where AMCP commands split into multiple TCP packets where not
    correctly parsed (http://casparcg.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2480)



CasparCG Server 2.0.7 Beta 1 (as compared to 2.0.6 Stable)
==========================================================

General
-------
 * FFmpeg: Upgraded to master and adapted CasparCG to FFmpeg API changes
    (Robert Nagy sponsored by SVT)
 * FFmpeg: Fixed problem with frame count calculation (Thomas Kaltz III)
 * Fixed broken CG UPDATE.

Producers
---------

 * New HTML producer has been created (Robert Nagy sponsored by Flemish Radio
    and Television Broadcasting Organization, VRT)



CasparCG Server 2.0.6 Stable (as compared to 2.0.4 Stable)
==========================================================

General
-------
 * iVGA: Allow for the server to work without Processing.AirSend.x86.dll to
    prevent a possible GPL violation. It is available as a separate optional
    download.
 * iVGA: Only provide sync to channel while connected, to prevent channel
    ticking too fast.
 * FFmpeg: Fixed bug during deinterlace-bob-reinterlace where output fields
    were offset by one field in relation to input fields.
 * FFmpeg: Fixed bug in ffmpeg_consumer where an access violation occurred
    during destruction.
 * FFmpeg: Improved seeking. (Robert Nagy and Thomas Kaltz III)
 * Frontend: Only writes elements to casparcg.config which overrides a default
    value to keep the file as compact as possible.
 * System audio: Patched sfml-audio to work better with oal-consumer and
    therefore removed PortAudio as the system audio implementation and went back
    to oal.
 * Flash: Changed so that the initial buffer fill of frames is rendered at a
    frame-duration pace instead of as fast as possible. Otherwise time based
    animations render incorrectly. During buffer recovery, a higher paced
    rendering takes place, but still not as fast as possible, which can cause
    animations to be somewhat incorrectly rendered. This is the only way though
    if we want the buffer to be able to recover after depletion.
 * Fixed race condition during server shutdown.
 * OSC: outgoing audio levels from the audio mixer for each audio channel is
    now transmitted (pFS and dBFS). (Thomas Kaltz III)
 * Stage: Fixed bug where tweened transforms were only ticked when a
    corresponding layer existed.
 * Screen consumer: Added borderless option and correct handling of name
    option. (Thomas Kaltz III)
 * AMCP: CLS now reports duration and framerate for MOVIE files were
    information is possible to extract. (Robert Nagy)
 * Version bump to keep up with CasparCG Client version.



CasparCG Server 2.0.4 Stable (as compared to 2.0.4 Beta 1)
==========================================================

General
-------
 * Can now open media with file names that only consist of digits.
    (Cambell Prince)
 * Miscellaneous stability and performance improvements.

Video mixer
-----------
 * Conditional compilation of chroma key support and straight alpha output
    support in shader (just like with blend-modes) because of performance impact
    even when not in use on a layer or on a channel. New <mixer /> element added
    to configuration for turning on mixer features that not everybody would want
    to pay for (performance-wise.) blend-modes also moved into this element.
 * Fixed bug where MIXER LEVELS interpreted arguments in the wrong order, so
    that gamma was interpreted as max_input and vice versa.

Consumers
---------
 * Added support for NewTek iVGA, which enables the use of CasparCG Server
    fill+key output(s) as input source(s) to a NewTek TriCaster without
    requiring video card(s) in the CasparCG Server machine, or taking up inputs
    in the TriCaster. <newtek-ivga /> element in config enables iVGA on a
    channel. (Robert Nagy sponsored by NewTek)
 * DeckLink: Created custom decklink allocator to reduce the memory footprint.
 * Replaced usage of SFML for <system-audio /> with PortAudio, because of
    problems with SFML since change to static linkage. Also PortAudio seems to
    give lower latency.

Producers
---------
 * FFmpeg: Added support for arbitrary FFmpeg options/parameters
    in ffmpeg_producer. (Cambell Prince)
 * Flash: Flash Player 11.8 now tested and fully supported.
 * Flash: No longer starts a Flash Player to service CG commands that mean
    nothing without an already running Flash Player.
 * Flash: globally serialize initialization and destruction of Flash Players,
    to avoid race conditions in Flash.
 * Flash: changed so that the Flash buffer is filled with Flash Player
    generated content at initialization instead of empty frames.

OSC
---
 * Performance improvements. (Robert Nagy sponsored by Boffins Technologies)
 * Never sends old values to OSC receivers. Collects the latest value of each
    path logged since last UDP send, and sends the new UDP packet (to each
    subscribing OSC receiver) with the values collected. (Robert Nagy sponsored
    by Boffins Technologies)
 * Batches as many OSC messages as possible in an OSC bundle to reduce the
    number of UDP packets sent. Breakup into separate packages if necessary to
    avoid fragmentation. (Robert Nagy sponsored by Boffins Technologies)
 * Removed usage of Microsoft Agents library (Server ran out of memory after a
    while) in favour of direct synchronous invocations.



CasparCG Server 2.0.4 Beta 1 (as compared to 2.0.3 Stable)
==========================================================

General
-------
 * Front-end GUI for simplified configuration and easy access to common tasks.
    (Thomas Kaltz III and Jeff Lafforgue)
 * Added support for video and images file thumbnail generation. By default the
    media directory is scanned every 5 seconds for new/modified/removed files
    and thumbnails are generated/regenerated/removed accordingly.
 * Support for new video modes: 1556p2398, 1556p2400, 1556p2500, 2160p2398,
    2160p2400, 2160p2500, 2160p2997 and 2160p3000.
 * Experimental ATI graphics card support by using static linking against SFML
    instead of dynamic. Should improve ATI GPU support, but needs testing.
 * Added support for playback and pass-through of up to 16 audio channels. See
    http://casparcg.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1453 for more information.
 * Optimizations in AMCP protocol implementations for large incoming messages,
    for example base64 encoded PNG images.
 * Logging output now includes milliseconds and has modified format:
    YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.zzz
 * Improved audio playback with 720p5994 and 720p6000 channels.
 * An attempt to improve output synchronization of consumers has been made. Use
    for example:

    <consumers>
      <synchronizing>
        <decklink>
          <device>1</device>
          <embedded-audio>true</embedded-audio>
        </decklink>
        <decklink>
          <device>2</device>
          <key-only>true</key-only>
        </decklink>
      </synchronizing>
    </consumers>

    ...to instruct the server to keep both DeckLink consumers in sync with each
    other. Consider this experimental, so don't wrap everything in
    <synchronizing /> unless synchronization of consumer outputs is needed. For
    synchronization to be effective all synchronized cards must have genlock
    reference signal connected.
 * Transfer of source code and issue tracker to github. (Thomas Kaltz III)

Layer
-----
 * Fixed a problem where the first frame was not always shown on LOAD.
    (Robert Nagy)

Stage
-----

 * Support for layer consumers for listening to frames coming out of producers.
    (Cambell Prince)

Audio mixer
-----------
 * Added support for a master volume mixer setting for each channel.

Video mixer
-----------
 * Added support for chroma keying. (Cambell Prince)
 * Fixed bug where MIXER CONTRAST set to < 1 can cause transparency issues.
 * Experimental support for straight alpha output.

Consumers
---------
 * Avoid that the FFmpeg consumer blocks the channel output when it can't keep
    up with the frame rate (drops frames instead).
 * Added support for to create a separate key and fill file when recording with
    the FFmpeg consumer. Add the SEPARATE_KEY parameter to the FFmpeg consumer
    parameter list. The key file will get the _A file name suffix to be picked
    up by the separated_producer when doing playback.
 * The Image consumer now writes to the media folder instead of the data
    folder.
 * Fixed bug in DeckLink consumer where we submit too few audio samples to the
    driver when the video format has a frame rate > 50.
 * Added another experimental DeckLink consumer implementation where scheduled
    playback is not used, but a similar approach as in the bluefish consumer
    where we wait for a frame to be displayed and then display the next frame.
    It is configured via a <blocking-decklink> consumer element. The benefits of
    this consumer is lower latency and more deterministic synchronization
    between multiple instances (should not need to be wrapped in a
    <synchronizing> element when separated key/fill is used).

Producers
---------
 * Added support for playing .swf files using the Flash producer. (Robert Nagy)
 * Image producer premultiplies PNG images with their alpha.
 * Image producer can load a PNG image encoded as base64 via:
    PLAY 1-0 [PNG_BASE64] <base64 string>
 * FFmpeg producer can now use a directshow input filters:
    PLAY 1-10 "dshow://video=Some Camera"
    (Cambell Prince, Julian Waller and Robert Nagy)
 * New layer producer which directs the output of a layer to another layer via
    a layer consumer. (Cambell Prince)

AMCP
----
 * The master volume feature is controlled via the MASTERVOLUME MIXER
    parameter. Example: MIXER 1 MASTERVOLUME 0.5
 * THUMBNAIL LIST/RETRIEVE/GENERATE/GENERATE_ALL command was added to support
    the thumbnail feature.
 * ADD 1 FILE output.mov SEPARATE_KEY activates the separate key feature of the
    FFmpeg consumer creating an additional output_a.mov containing only the key.
 * Added KILL command for shutting down the server without console access.
 * Added RESTART command for shutting down the server in the same way as KILL
    except that the return code from CasparCG Server is 5 instead of 0, which
    can be used by parent process to take other actions. The
    'casparcg_auto_restart.bat' script restarts the server if the return code is
    5.
 * DATA RETRIEVE now returns linefeeds encoded as an actual linefeed (the
    single character 0x0a) instead of the previous two characters:
    \ followed by n.
 * MIXER CHROMA command added to control the chroma keying. Example:
    MIXER 1-1 CHROMA GREEN|BLUE 0.10 0.04
    (Cambell Prince)
 * Fixed bug where MIXER FILL overrides any previous MIXER CLIP on the same
    layer. The bug-fix also has the side effect of supporting negative scale on
    MIXER FILL, causing the image to be flipped.
 * MIXER <ch> STRAIGHT_ALPHA_OUTPUT added to control whether to output straight
    alpha or not.
 * Added INFO <ch> DELAY and INFO <ch>-<layer> DELAY commands for showing some
    delay measurements.
 * PLAY 1-1 2-10 creates a layer producer on 1-1 redirecting the output of
    2-10. (Cambell Prince)

OSC
---
 * Support for sending OSC messages over UDP to either a predefined set of
    clients (servers in the OSC sense) or dynamically to the ip addresses of the
    currently connected AMCP clients.
    (Robert Nagy sponsored by Boffins Technologies)
 * /channel/[1-9]/stage/layer/[0-9]
   * always             /paused           [paused or not]
   * color producer     /color            [color string]
   * ffmpeg producer    /profiler/time    [render time]     [frame duration]
   * ffmpeg producer    /file/time        [elapsed seconds] [total seconds]
   * ffmpeg producer    /file/frame       [frame]           [total frames]
   * ffmpeg producer    /file/fps         [fps]
   * ffmpeg producer    /file/path        [file path]
   * ffmpeg producer    /loop             [looping or not]
   * during transitions /transition/frame [current frame]   [total frames]
   * during transitions /transition/type  [transition type]
   * flash producer     /host/path        [filename]
   * flash producer     /host/width       [width]
   * flash producer     /host/height      [height]
   * flash producer     /host/fps         [fps]
   * flash producer     /buffer           [buffered]        [buffer size]
   * image producer     /file/path        [file path]



CasparCG Server 2.0.3 Stable (as compared to 2.0.3 Alpha)
=========================================================

Stage
-----

 * Fixed dead-lock that can occur with multiple mixer tweens. (Robert Nagy)

AMCP
----

 * DATA STORE now supports creating folders of path specified if they does not
    exist. (Jeff Lafforgue)
 * DATA REMOVE command was added. (Jeff Lafforgue)



CasparCG Server 2.0.3 Alpha (as compared to 2.0 Stable)
=======================================================

General
-------

 * Data files are now stored in UTF-8 with BOM. Latin1 files are still
    supported for backwards compatibility.
 * Commands written in UTF-8 to log file but only ASCII characters to console.
 * Added supported video formats:
   * 720p2398 (not supported by DeckLink)
   * 720p2400 (not supported by DeckLink)
   * 1080p5994
   * 1080p6000
   * 720p30 (not supported by DeckLink)
   * 720p29.976 (not supported by DeckLink)

CLK
---

 * CLK protocol implementation can now serve more than one connection at a time
    safely.
 * Added timeline support to the CLK protocol.
 * Refactored parts of the CLK parser implementation.

Consumers
---------

 * Consumers on same channel now invoked asynchronously to allow for proper
    sync of multiple consumers.
 * System audio consumer:
   * no longer provides sync to the video channel.
 * Screen consumer:
   * Support for multiple screen consumers on the same channel
   * No longer spin-waits for vsync.
   * Now deinterlaces to two separate frames so for example 50i will no longer
      be converted to 25p but instead to 50p for smooth playback of interlaced
      content.
 * DeckLink consumer now logs whether a reference signal is detected or not.

Producers
---------

 * Image scroll producer:
   * Field-rate motion instead of frame-rate motion with interlaced video
      formats. This can be overridden by giving the PROGRESSIVE parameter.
   * SPEED parameter now defines pixels per frame/field instead of half pixels
      per frame. The scrolling direction is also reversed so SPEED 0.5 is the
      previous equivalent of SPEED -1. Movements are done with sub-pixel
      accuracy.
   * Fixed incorrect starting position of image.
   * Rounding error fixes to allow for more exact scrolling.
   * Added support for motion blur via a new BLUR parameter
   * Added PREMULTIPLY parameter to support images stored with straight alpha.



CasparCG Server 2.0 Stable (as compared to Beta 3)
==================================================

General
-------

 * Misc stability and performance fixes.

Consumers
---------

 * File Consumer
   * Changed semantics to more closely follow FFmpeg (see forums).
   * Added options, -r, -acodec, -s, -pix_fmt, -f and more.
 * Screen Consumer
   * Added vsync support.



CasparCG Server 2.0 Beta 3 (as compared to Beta 1)
==================================================

Formats
-------

 * ProRes Support
   * Both encoding and decoding.
 * NTSC Support
   * Updated audio-pipeline for native NTSC support. Previous implementation
      did not fully support NTSC audio and could cause incorrect behaviour or
      even crashes.

Consumers
---------

 * File Consumer added
   * See updated wiki or ask in forum for more information.
   * Should support anything FFmpeg supports. However, we will work mainly with
      DNxHD, PRORES and H264.
    - Key-only is not supported.
 * Bluefish Consumer
   * 24 bit audio support.
    - Embedded-audio does not work with Epoch cards.
 * DeckLink Consumer
   * Low latency enabled by default.
   * Added graphs for driver buffers.
 * Screen Consumer
   * Changed screen consumer square PAL to the more common wide-square PAL.
   * Can now be closed.
   * Fixed interpolation artifacts when running non-square video-modes.
   * Automatically deinterlace interlaced input.

Producers
---------

 * DeckLink Producer
   * Improved color quality be avoiding unnecessary conversion to BGRA.
 * FFMPEG Producer
   * Fixed missing alpha for (RGB)A formats when deinterlacing.
   * Updated buffering to work better with files with long audio/video
      interleaving.
   * Seekable while running and after reaching EOF. CALL 1-1 SEEK 200.
   * Enable/disable/query looping while running. CALL 1-1 LOOP 1.
   * Fixed bug with duration calculation.
   * Fixed bug with fps calculation.
   * Improved auto-transcode accuracy.
   * Improved seeking accuracy.
   * Fixed bug with looping and LENGTH.

   * Fixed incorrect scaling of NTSC DV files.
   * Optimized color conversion when using YADIF filters.
 * Flash Producer
   * Release Flash Player when empty.
   * Use native resolution TemplateHost.
   * TemplateHosts are now chosen automatically if not configured. The
      TemplateHost with the corresponding video-mode name is now chosen.
   * Use square pixel dimensions.

AMCP
----

 * When possible, commands will no longer wait for rendering pipeline. This
    reduces command execution latencies, especially when sending a lot of
    commands in a short timespan.
 * Fixed CINF command.
 * ADD/REMOVE no longer require subindex,
    e.g. "ADD 1 SCREEN" / "REMOVE 1 SCREEN" instead of "ADD 1-1 SCREEN" / ...
 * PARAM is renamed to CALL.
 * STATUS command is replaced by INFO.
 * INFO command has been extended:
   * INFO (lists channels).
   * INFO 1 (channel info).
   * INFO 1-1 (layer info).
   * INFO 1-1 F (foreground producer info).
   * INFO 1-1 B (background producer info).
   * INFO TEMPLATE mytemplate (template meta-data info, e.g. field names).
 * CG INFO command has been extended.
   * CG INFO 1 (template-host information, e.g. what layers are occupied).
