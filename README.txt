CasparCG Server 2.0.4 Beta 1
============================

play out and record professional graphics, audio and video to multiple outputs.
It has been in 24/7 broadcast production since 2006.

proven stability!

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

1. Intel processor capable of using SSSE3 instructions. Please refer to
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSSE3 for a complete list.
   While AMD processors should work, CasparCG Server has only been tested on
   Intel processors.

2. We recommend Windows 7 (64-bit,) but this software has also been used
   successfully on Windows 7 (32-bit) and Windows XP SP2 (32-bit only.)
   Using CasparCG Server on Windows 8 and Windows Vista is untested and
   is not recommended!

3. An NVIDIA graphics card (GPU) capable of OpenGL 3.0 or higher is strongly
   recommended!
   Please check your card's capabilities at:
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Nvidia_graphics_processing_units
   Make sure that you have the latest drivers installed:
   http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us%20nVidia%20drivers

   Experimental support for AMD/ATI cards has been added, but it has not been
   fully tested.

   Graphics cards from other manufacturers _may_ work but have not been tested!

4. Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package must be installed.
   Free download at:
   http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5555

5. You must have Flash Player 10.3 or later installed (an installer can be found
   in the "Flash Player Installation" folder.)

6. Make sure you turn off Windows' "Aero" theme and "ClearType" font smoothing
   as they have been known to interfere with transparency in Flash templates,
   and can also cause problems with Vsync when outputting to computer screens.
